## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to create your stunning portfolio? It's incredibly simple!

**For detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to get your OpenFlex portfolio up and running, please refer to our comprehensive `Instructions.md` file.**

This guide will walk you through everything from getting the code and configuring your `resume-data.json` to deploying your site with Vercel.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Deep Dive

The heart of OpenFlex is the `src/config/resume-data.json` file. This is where you'll define all the content for your website.

We've made it super easy to understand and update. **For a complete guide on what each section and field in `resume-data.json` means and how to fill it out, please see our comprehensive `Instructions.md` file.**

A few key things you'll be able to customize:
*   Personal details (name, title, contact info, social links)
*   Theme colors (though the default dark theme is pretty slick!)
*   Hero section content (badge, title, subtitle, CTAs)
*   Detailed "About Me" paragraphs and highlights
*   Skill ratings and tool proficiencies
*   Project showcases with descriptions, tech stacks, and links
*   Work experience timeline
*   Education and certifications
*   FAQ section
*   Contact details, including a map URL

## üöÄ Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your OpenFlex portfolio is with **Vercel**.

1.  Click the "Deploy with Vercel" button at the top of this README.
2.  It will prompt you to create a new Git repository (a clone of OpenFlex) under your GitHub account.
